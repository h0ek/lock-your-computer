# lock-your-computer

You walk by a company computer and see an unblocked computer with no owner, you're nosy, you work in security or you just want to make a joke for your friend from work. Then you're in the right place.

Download files from these repo and run them from the USB drive.
Quick way to send funny email and change wallpaper in one place.

(If your company allows to run scripts from USB drive, this mean security in your company sucks, so unlocked computer is the last thing that should bother anyone)

Edit unlockedpc.ps1 and change values of $Mail.To, $Mail.Subject, $Mail.Body to whatever you want. Save it.
Copy security_was_here.bmp, start.cmd and unlockedpc.ps1 files to USB drive. Go to the victim PC. Plug the USB drive and double click on start.cmd.

Done, email is sent and wallpaper is changed.
